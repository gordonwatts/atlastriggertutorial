Source files for a short Trigger Tutorial

Usage
=====

To modify these files you can create an "experimental" directory and use that for testing,
and then run buildtriggertutorial.sh to copy files out of that and back into your home direcotry.

1. setupATLAS
2. Edit the distribution/packages.txt file to make sure it has no more than you need
3. ./triggertutorial.sh 2.2.X,rel_2
4. mv test experimental

  And that should be all you need.
